Notes:

Russia still accusing Ukraine (03.25.2019)... TASS and UK Daily Mirror 

First Bellingcat report: Efforts to Geolocate the Launcher 07/17/14
Countless example of Elliot Higgins & team getting trolled since, popular hashtag is #bellingcrap

This is a good summary: 
“But not only did Russia fiercely deny those accusations, a number of Russian leaders, officials and broadcasters responded by offering dozens of different alternative explanations, “including quite outlandish theories,” says Nilsson.

“For instance, that an airplane would’ve been loaded with already dead people and that Ukrainian airplanes would then have shot it down to make it look like Russia was shooting down passenger airplanes,” he explains.

“There were tons of these stories going around, quite a few of them coming from official Russian sources. And they were not meant to be taken seriously. They were simply supposed to occupy the attention span of the world for a while, to the extent that everyone would lose track of the original explanation, which turned out to be quite the right one.” https://globalnews.ca/news/4993120/russia-rising-part-5-maskirovka/

Topics of Ukraine-related narratives
http://euromaidanpress.com/2018/12/06/ukraine-related-narratives-dominate-russian-propaganda/
Back in 2016, StopFake co-founder Yevhen Fedchenko identified 18 major Ukraine-related fake narrative topics spread by Russian propaganda by analyzing 500 debunked disinformation items.
The Euromaidan Revolution as a “coup d’état“
Ukraine as a “fascist state“
Ukraine as a “failed state“
“Russia is not a part of the occupation/war in Ukraine“
Discrediting the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF)
Discrediting the volunteer battalions (which officially became a part of UAF in 2015)
Donbas and Crimean internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees
Territorial disintegration of Ukraine
“Territorial claims” for parts of Ukraine from neighboring Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia
Fake “international legitimization” of annexation and occupation of Crimea
The war in Ukraine “conducted by the US, NATO or Western private contractors”
The West’s “Ukraine fatigue“
Manipulating international organizations
Fakes about EU-Ukraine relations
“Decay” of the US and West in general, and the “disintegration of the EU”
Flight MH17 crash fakes
The West “uses biological weapons” in Ukraine
Mix-ups of the fake narratives about Ukraine, Syria, ISIS terrorists (e.g., Crimean Tatars being depicted as jihadists or Ukraine as a training ground for terrorists)
For post-Maidan Ukraine, Russian propaganda’s most used narratives were the Euromaidan as “coup d’etat” which brought a “Western-backed junta” (mostly “US-backed”) to power, and “fascism” as the main ideology of the post-Maidan government, Fedchenko notes.
