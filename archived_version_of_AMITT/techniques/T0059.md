# Technique T0059: Play the long game

* **Summary**: Play the long game can mean a couple of things:
1. To plan messaging and allow it to grow organically without conducting your own amplification. This is methodical and slow and requires years for the message to take hold
2. To develop a series of seemingly disconnected messaging narratives that eventually combine into a newÂ narrative.

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA11
