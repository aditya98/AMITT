# AMITT Disinformation Tactics, Techniques and Processes (TTP) Framework

AMITT (Adversarial Misinformation and Influence Tactics and Techniques) has a new name: **DISARM**, and a new home: [https://github.com/DISARMFoundation/DISARMframeworks/](https://github.com/DISARMFoundation/DISARMframeworks/)

This reflects work by MITRE, FIU, and CogSecCollab teams to merge the AM!TT and SP!CE frameworks, and create a new organization, the **[DISARM Foundation](https://www.disarm.foundation/)**, to manage DISARM.

DISARM is a framework designed for describing and understanding disinformation incidents. DISARM is part of work on adapting information security (infosec) practices to help track and counter disinformation and other information harms, and is designed to fit existing infosec practices and tools.

DISARM's style is based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework. STIX templates for DISARM objects are available in the DISARM_CTI repo - these make it easy for DISARM data to be passed between ISAOs and similar bodies using standards like TAXII.

[The DISARM Foundation](https://www.disarm.foundation/)** maintains and updates the DISARM family of models: DISARM-STIX, the DISARM Red framework (of disinformation creation), and the DISARM Blue framework (of disinformation countermeasures and mitigations).  

- all framework updates will be in the DISARM repo from now on.
