DO NOT EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE - PLEASE ADD NOTES BELOW 

Suspected actors:

* Attacker: IRA or more broadly Russian state-sponsored disinformation campaign.
* Amplifiers: through the persona of “Adam Garrie” (who first appeared on RT (Russian Today) and pro-Russia sites, with no background in Asia and Philippine affairs but suddenly rose to become a global affairs expert).
* Garrie was then promoted by pro-Duterte officials, social media pages and news outlets.
 
Timeframe: After Putin and Philippine’s president Duterte met in Russia in May 2017 and forged a partnership in information dissemination. Duterte and Putin signed a number of national security agreements, including a deal on intelligence sharing, an “MOU on Cooperation in Mass Communications.”
 
Date: 2017- ongoing

Presumed goals:

* To spread pro-Duterte and Russian propaganda through collaborative effort of both Philippine and Russian disinformation actors.

Method:
 
* Footprint of Garrie on the Philippine media scene started from his connection with Russian IRA websites and pages (GI Analytics Facebook page, Russia Insider, The Duran, Geopolitica.ru, Mint Press News, Oriental Review, globalresearch.ca.)
 
* RT, one of media outlets that interviewed Garrie, was identified by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence in January 2017 as the primary source of propaganda that the Russians used to further their interests in the 2016 US elections.
 
* Also has appearance on Iran’s IRIB (Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting), which was identified by the US Department of the Treasury in 2013 as a network that broadcasts false reports and forced confessions of political detainees and has ties with “politically motivated phishing” accounts on Google.
 
* The Daily Sentry, a Philippine news site emerged at the start of 2018 (no ownership information), started citing Adam Garrie as a global expert after Philippine-Russian ties grew stronger. Between Feb 2018 and Jan 2019, The Daily Sentry cited Garrie in 41% of posts on Facebook that mentioned experts.
 
* By March 2018, Garrie started to come to the mainstream: The Manila Times – a supporter outlet of the Philippine president, cited by pro-Duterte social media pages.
 
* Philippine online groups and pages began to spread Russian propaganda. Some sites link to Duterte officials and supporters including Duterte’s former assistant secretary. For example, Duterte’s former assistant secretary shared content from Trending News Portal site.
 
Counters:

* Facebook took down 220 pages and 73 Philippine accounts for spam, including pages of The Daily Sentry and its affiliates, TNP page and related pages.
