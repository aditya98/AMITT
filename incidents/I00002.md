Actor: IRA, individuals (e.g. Larry Cook).

Timeframe: 

Date: 

Presumed goals:
Physical damage to country? 

Method: 

* Targetted facebook ads (Larry Cook, targetting Washington State mothers, $1,776 to boost posts over 9 months). 
* Gofundme campaigns to pay for ads (Larry Cook)

Effects:

* “The U.S. anti-vax movement has been blamed for two outbreaks of measles that have infected some 300 people—mostly children—in New York and the Pacific Northwest.”

Counters:

* American Medical Association “warned social-media giants, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Twitter, and YouTube, that they were helping to amplify the propaganda and confuse parents.”
* Gofundme banned antivaxxers: “Campaigns raising money to promote misinformation about vaccines violate GoFundMe’s terms of service and will be removed from the platform”.  Less than 10 campaigns reported as removed.

Related incidents:

Artefacts:

Search terms vaccination, anti-vaccination, “vaccine choice”. 

Notes:

Started by looking for vaccine-related content in my misinformation datasets
Then did google search for “antivax misinformation” to get references etc. 
Larry Cook runs “Stop Mandatory Vaccination”: “donations go “directly” to his bank account and funds “may be used to pay [his] personal bills.”
