Notes

First i read the cnn article, then did a twitter search to see if there are traces of the accounts left online.  Only discussion about the IRA operation seem to be on Twitter.  Also searched twitter for some of the text found later (in datasets) - nothing matches. 
Reading the docnow.io post showed some interesting behavours.  Also that there was no central data repo for the blacktivists posts.  Classic was the tweets being sent only in 8am-6pm Moscow time. Also interesting: the followers grew over time, but they grew and dropped friends (people they followed) in batches periodically - was this to avoid hitting limits? 
Reading the dailybeast.com article (on an IRA leak), it seems specific individuals were targetted.  Thinking about the places we need to search: if it’s Russia, seems like we need to check twitter, facebook, youtube, reddit, tumblr, instagram, 9gag. 
Names some of the people contacted, e.g. Craig Carson, a Rochester, New York, attorney and civil rights activist; maybe Shanall LaRay Logan—who lives in Sacramento, California;
