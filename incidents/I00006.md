DO NOT EDIT ABOVE THIS LINE - PLEASE ADD NOTES BELOW

Actor: probably IRA (source: recordedfuture)

Timeframe: 1 day

Date: Sept 11 2014

Presumed goals: test deployment

Method: 
* Artefacts: text messages, images, video
* Create messages. e.g. “A powerful explosion heard from miles away happened at a chemical plant in Centerville, Louisiana #ColumbianChemicals”
* Post messages from fake twitter accounts; include handles of local and global influencers (journalists, media, politicians, e.g. @senjeffmerkley)
* Amplify, by repeating messages on twitter via fake twitter accounts
* Not seen: interaction, refutation etc. 
* TL;DR: early attempts to create fake incidents had limited traction. 

Counters:

* None seen.  Fake stories were debunked very quickly. 

Related incidents: 

* BP oil spill tsunami
* #PhosphorusDisaster - fake story about water contamination scare
* #EbolaInAtlanta -  fake story about Ebola outbreak in Atlanta
* #shockingmurderinatlanta -  fake story about unarmed black woman killed by police in Atlanta

These were all well-produced fake news stories, promoted on Twitter to influencers through a single dominant hashtag (the single hashtag might have been something learned from crisismapping practice of forcing a single hashtag for each disaster because it was easier to track)
