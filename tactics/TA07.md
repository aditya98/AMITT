# Tactic TA07: Channel Selection

* **Summary:** Set up specific delivery, amplification and manipulation channels for incident, including channels to attack. Each channel serves as an atomic surface (test bed) location/site for adversary to hide/conceal the work/content that goes into setting up for this channel and/or other specific platforms. Contributes to building out a connected ecosystem where this channel can operate as part of a whole campaign/incident

* **Belongs to phase:** P02
