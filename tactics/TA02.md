# Tactic TA02: Objective Planning

* **Summary:** Set clearly defined, measurable, and achievable objectives. Achieving objectives ties execution of tactical tasks to reaching the desired end state. There are four primary considerations:
- Each desired effect should link directly to one or more objectives
- The effect should be measurable
- The objective statement should not specify the way and means of accomplishment
- The effect should be distinguishable from the objective it supports as a condition for success, not as another objective or task.

* **Belongs to phase:** P01
