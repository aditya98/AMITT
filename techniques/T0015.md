# Technique T0015: Create hashtag

* **Summary**: Many incident-based campaigns will create a hashtag to promote their fabricated event (e.g. #ColumbianChemicals to promote a fake story about a chemical spill in Louisiana). 

Creating a hashtag for an incident can have two important effects:
1. Create a perception of reality around an event. Certainly only "real" events would be discussed in a hashtag. After all, the event has a name!
2. Publicize the story more widely through trending lists and search behavior 

Asset needed to direct/control/manage "conversation" connected to launching new incident/campaign with new hashtag for applicable social media sites ie: Twitter, LinkedIn)
