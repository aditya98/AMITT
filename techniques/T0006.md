# Create Master Narratives

* **Type**: Technique

* **Name**: Create Master Narratives

* **Id**: T0006

* **Summary**: The promotion of beneficial master narratives is perhaps the most effective method for achieving long-term strategic narrative dominance. From a "whole of society" perpective the promotion of the society's core master narratives should occupy a central strategic role. From a misinformation campaign / cognitive security perpectve the tactics around master narratives center more precisely on the day-to-day promotion and reinforcement of this messaging. In other words, beneficial, high-coverage master narratives are a central strategic goal and their promotion consitutes an ongoing tactical struggle carried out at a whole-of-society level. 

By way of example, major powers are promoting master narratives such as:
* "Huawei is detetmined to build trustworthy networks"
* "Russia is the victim of bullying by NATO powers"
* "USA is guided by its founding principles of liberty and egalitarianism"

Tactically, their promotion covers a broad spectrum of activities both on- and offline.
