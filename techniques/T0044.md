# Technique T0044: Seed distortions

* **Summary**: Incident creators often try a wide variety of messages in the early hours surrounding an incident or event in order to give a misleading account or impression. 

Examples: (2019) China formally arrests Canadians Spavor and Kovrig, accuses them of spying (in retaliation to detention of Hauwei CFO). (2018) The Russian ministry of defence put out a press release, claiming that they had intelligence Syrian rebel forces were about to gas their own people in Idlib province as part of a “false flag” operation to frame the Syrian government.

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA08
