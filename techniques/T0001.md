# Technique T0001: 5Ds (dismiss, distort, distract, dismay, divide)

* **Summary**: Nimmo's "4Ds of propaganda": dismiss, distort, distract, dismay (MisinfosecWG added divide in 2019). Misinformation promotes an agenda by advancing narratives supportive of that agenda. This is most effective when the advanced narrative pre-dates the revelation of the specific misinformation content. This is often not possible.

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA01
