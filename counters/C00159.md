# Campaign mindset and associated toolbox

* **Type**: Counter TTP

* **Name**: Campaign mindset and associated toolbox

* **Id**: C00159

* **Summary**: A campaign plan for the gray zone must account for U.S. vulnerabilities and strengths and must take care not to over-rely on any one tool of statecraft or line of effort. If the United States is to engage seriously in gray zone competition, it will need to identify and employ a broad spectrum of its national power to deter, compete, and counter (where necessary) other countriesâ€™ approaches. It is therefore critical that the United States understands its own capabilities, the capabilities of its adversaries, and international standards of conduct to compete in, shrink the size, and ultimately deter use of the gray zone.
