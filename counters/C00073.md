# Counter C00073: Inoculate populations through media literacy training

* **Summary**: Educate on how to handle info pollution. Push out targeted education on why it's pollution.  Build cultural resistance to false content, e.g. cultural resistance to bullshit.  Influence literacy training, to inoculate against “cult” recruiting.  Media literacy training: leverage librarians / library for media literacy training. Inoculate at language.   Strategic planning included as inoculating population has strategic value. Example is the "Learn to Discern" Program, funded by the Canadian government, operated in Ukraine from July 2015 to March 2016. The program trained 15,000 Ukrainians in ‘’safe, informed media consumption techniques,’’ including avoiding emotional manipulation, verifying sources, identifying hate speech, verifying expert credentials, detecting censorship, and debunking news, photos, and videos.”  Covers detect, deny, and degrade.
