# Distract from noise with addictive content

* **Type**: Counter TTP

* **Name**: Distract from noise with addictive content

* **Id**: C00086

* **Summary**: Example: Interject addictive links or contents into discussions of disinformation materials and measure a "conversion rate" of users who engage with your content and away from the social media channel's "information bubble" around the disinformation item. Use bots to amplify and upvote the addictive content. 

Note: This sounds eerlily like many Reddit communities where the most upvoted comments are all jokes, preventing serious discussion from being discovered by those who filter by upvotes.
