# Counter C00044: Keep people from posting to social media immediately

* **Summary**: My interpretation is that this is method would be used to slow down activities or force a small delay between posts or replies to new posts.

* **Playbooks**: Rate restrict via regulation posting above a statistical threshold
Unless account is de-anonymized and advertised as automated messaging

* **Metatechnique**: M004 - friction

* **Resources needed:** R004 - platform algorithms

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA03
