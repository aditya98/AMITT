# Pollute the AB-testing data feeds

* **Type**: Counter TTP

* **Name**: Pollute the AB-testing data feeds

* **Id**: C00137

* **Summary**: Polluting A/B testing requires knowledge of MOEs and MOPs. A/B testing must be caught early when there is relatively little data available so infiltration of TAs and understanding of how content is migrated from testing to larger audiences is fundamental.

* **Playbooks**: Playbook 1: Promote damp squibs.  Within a known TA promote/inflate crappy off-brand memes which are unlikley to resonate.
Playbook 2: Detect early trending/engagement and undermine the content by responding with 5Ds, toxic community behaviour, satirical responses, etc.
Playbook 3: If adtech is used, fake clicks and engagements on the content.

* **Metatechnique**: data pollution

* **Resources needed:** 

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA11
