New content.  

If a group has the ability - e.g. enough dedicated person-hours - it can hijack the artifacts and narratives of a disinformation incident, by flooding them with counter-content.   This has been seen in the past as accidental hashtag flooding - e.g. a new disinformation hashtag was unknowingly chosen that was the same as a children's swim team, which became active during a swim meet.  In 2020, kPop stans flooded disinformation-carrying hashtags including #whitelivesmatter, and gay men flooded the #proudboys hashtag. 

This is an example of a countertechnique that mirrors an existing disinformation technique - in this case T0049.
