* **Type**: Counter TTP

* **Name**: Poison the monitoring & evaluation data

* **Id**: C00149

* **Summary**: nan

* **Playbooks**: Playbook 1: Distort TA demographics by posting irrelevant content, misleading demogaphic data, etc.
Playbook 2: Work with the media platform to distort publicly available metrics. Can we work with Twitter to get crappy off-brand memes artificially bumped without needing to create fake accounts, etc.?
Playbook 3: Use adtech to promote content inconsistent with TA demographics.  If the adversary is reverse engineering a groups demographics by analyzing ads placed on the platform/group, by spamming ads for out-group stuff it may distort analysis of the group.
Playbook 4: Distort Google Trends and other publicly available source of metrics using bots, cyborgs, adtech.
Playbook 5: Distort TA emotional response to content/narratives.

* **Metatechnique**: data pollution

* **Resources needed:** nan

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA12
