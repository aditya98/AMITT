Influencers encourage people to remove their inactive accounts  "Do you really need that old account" campaign, world-war-two poster-style.  Create alternative memorial websites for accounts of deceased people, so their accounts can't be reactivated on 'live' sites. Educate/scare users on the risks of losing control over a dormant account (would their employer be forgiving if an account associated with the user suddenly starting posting extremist content?).

* **Metatechnique**: cleaning

* **Resources needed:** platform_admin,platform_admin:socialmedia,public:account_owners

* **Belongs to tactic stage**: TA04
