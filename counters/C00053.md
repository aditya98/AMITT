# Counter C00053: Delete old accounts / Remove unused social media accounts

* **Summary**: 

* **Playbooks**: Social media companies remove inactive accounts. Account holders remove accounts they're no longer using. Influencers encourage people to remove their inactive accounts "Do you really need that old account" campaign, world-war-two poster-style. Create alternative memorial websites for accounts of deceased people, so their accounts can't be reactivated on 'live' sites. Educate/scare users on the risks of losing control over a dormant account (would their employer be forgiving if an account associated with the user suddenly starting posting extremist content?).
