# Demuting content

* **Type**: Counter TTP

* **Name**: Demuting content

* **Id**: C00085

* **Summary**: Unsure. My interpretation is that disinformation campaigns can be disrupted by archiving their contents online, for intelligence analysis and public transparency.

In some phases, contents would be archives of websites, social media profiles, media and copies of published advertisements.

In others, content would be archives of comments attributed to bad actors, as well as anonymized metadata about users who interacted with them and analysis of the effect.

Having these tagged and shamed for as associated by bad actors would be beneficial for public vigilance.
