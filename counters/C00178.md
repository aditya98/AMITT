* **Summary**: e.g. increase Russian-language programming. The Economist notes, in May, Current Time videos were viewed 40 million times online (“America’s Answer to Russian Propaganda TV,” 2017). It would certainly be a positive development if Current Time could draw viewers away from Russian TV programming of RT and Sputnik. One effort that might assist in this regard is expanding programming to include more conventional entertainment programming
